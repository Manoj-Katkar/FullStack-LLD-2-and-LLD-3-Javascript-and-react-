<script type="text/babel">    //*change the type as = text/babel (That I have to tell which javascript code it should parse JSX code to react elements)

    // selecting the root Element
    let rootElement = document.querySelector("#root");

    // !Creating the functional Componenets 
    // !Note : We use Pascal case to write the Naming convention of the Functinal Componenents (Means first letter capital)

    //below we have added the html code inside the javascript code that is known as the JSX (Javascript XML)

    function App(){

        return <h1>Hello From React Using Functional Components</h1>;   //this line is JSX Code 
    }

    //App -> is a Functional Components -> which returns the JSX
    // <h1>Hello From React Using Functional Componenets</h1> -> this is JSX -> Html merged with JS 
    
    //!Now rendering the functional components in the root element 
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);  //App custom tag will contain the virtual DOM


    // *! How Javascript will identify the it is JSX : 
                                    
    // * ^if any function is returning the html code then javascript will able to get to know that it is JSX 
    //* ^ and That JSX will return the virtual DOM Where All the react elements are going to be there in it 


    //learned about CDN , creating elements in React , rendering elements in React , JSX (Javascript XML) , Babel to parse JSX elements to React elements , functional Componenets
